# TSTKYSAFE

The purpose of this site is to create a way for people to check in and see who else is present in different parts of Kentuckyâ€”or beyondâ€”without sacrificing their anonymity.  
You may have to disclose some data, but it will be kept private and protected.

We're too broke to sell your data, but we're smart enough to secure it.

Using the Google API and mapping tools, weâ€™ll create a drag-and-drop interface so users can check in with approximate locations. This can also be used to alert others in your areaâ€”or everyoneâ€”if you choose to share. Checkin location can also be turned off or on which might alert people in a specified range. 

The ultimate goal isnâ€™t just a community roll call.  
Itâ€™s a **safe haven** for people who might not otherwise have one.  

Living rough is hard. You shouldn't have to do it alone.
