# TSTKYSAFE

The purpose of this site is to create a way for people to check in and see who else is present in different parts of Kentucky—or beyond—without sacrificing their anonymity.  
You may have to disclose some data, but it will be kept private and protected.

We're too broke to sell your data, but we're smart enough to secure it.

Using the Google API and mapping tools, we’ll create a drag-and-drop interface so users can check in with approximate locations. This can also be used to alert others in your area—or everyone—if you choose to share.

The ultimate goal isn’t just a community roll call.  
It’s a **safe haven** for people who might not otherwise have one.  

Living rough is hard. You shouldn't have to do it alone.
